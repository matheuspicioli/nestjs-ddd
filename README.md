# DDD with NestJS, without framework coupling

The idea is practing DDD with NestJS, but also isolate the domain from the NestJS and its dependencies

## Run

### Start

Create a .env file and put the PORT variable, if you don't do it, the applications will be started at port 3000

Start the application with these commands:

```bash
npm install && npm run start:dev
```

You can configure our HTTP client with http://localhost:<PORT>

### Tests

Run application tests with this command:

```bash
npm run tests
```
